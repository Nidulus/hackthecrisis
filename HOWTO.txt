Download sdk for Windows or Linux (or let me know if you use mac like I do, I have a version for that too unreleased)
https://platform.nidulus.io

unzip

usage:

sdk.exe --new demand_add
sdk.exe --build demand_add

This will generate a builds/demand_add.zip in your sdk folder. This is used for new services or updated services (always build after changing) to be uploaded in the web gui for the platform.

go to http://188.212.108.155:7999/ and login with admin/password
Click on "Process Llist
Click on "Services" and "Add new Service", or find the existing and click Update. Upload the zip
